# Vue.js Client Management System

## Utilizing REST API and Vue Router for Dynamic Web Applications

Welcome to the Vue.js Client Management System! In this project, I harness the power of Vue.js combined with Vue Router and a RESTful API to create a robust and interactive client management interface. This project represents my journey into the depths of modern web development, solving real-world challenges of data management and user interaction in business applications.

### Why This Project?

As a developer, I've always been drawn to the challenge of making data interaction seamless and efficient. The main motivation for this project was to streamline the process of managing client information in a way that is both intuitive and powerful. The goal was to develop a system that allows users to easily add, edit, and validate client data, all while ensuring high performance and responsiveness.

### Key Features and Functionality

This application is designed to manage client data effectively. Here's what it can do:

- **Client Data Management**: Add, edit, and delete client information through a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Form Validation**: Utilize Form Kit to ensure that all data entered meets specific criteria before submission, enhancing data integrity.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **REST API Integration**: Interact with a backend server using RESTful principles, ensuring that data is consistent and stateless across interactions.

### Getting Started

To begin using this project, follow these steps to set up the environment and run the application:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vue-client-manager.git

# Change directory
cd vue-client-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run serve
Access the application at http://localhost:8080 and explore various functionalities like adding a new client, editing existing clients, and navigating through different views using Vue Router.

## How to Use the Application

# Adding a Client:

Navigate to the 'Add Client' page using the navigation bar.
Fill in the fields in the form, such as name, surname, email, and phone. Note that fields like the phone number must match a specific pattern to be accepted.
Click 'Submit' to save the client's information, which will be posted to the REST API and appear in the client list.
Editing and Deleting Clients:

To edit a client, click 'Edit' next to the client's details, make any necessary changes, and save.
To delete a client, select 'Delete', and confirm the action. The client's information will be removed from the list and the backend.

## Final Thoughts

This project is an excellent example of how modern web technologies can be used to solve practical problems in data management. By integrating Vue.js with a REST API and other tools like Form Kit and Vue Router, we can create powerful, flexible, and user-friendly applications.
